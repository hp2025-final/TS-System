# GST Tax Calculation Fix - Complete

## Issue Fixed
The Point of Sale (POS) system was incorrectly calculating GST (tax) on the discounted price instead of the original price before discount. This has been corrected to follow proper accounting practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend (POS Interface)
**File:** `resources/js/components/pos/AdvancedPOS.vue`

**Tax Calculation Logic:**
```javascript
const tax = computed(() => {
  return cart.value.reduce((sum, item) => {
    // GST should be calculated on original price (before discount)
    const originalPrice = item.dress.sale_price
    const taxPercentage = item.dress.tax_percentage || 0
    return sum + (originalPrice * taxPercentage / 100)
  }, 0)
})
```

**Display Update:**
- Changed from "Tax:" to "GST (18%):" to clearly show the tax type and percentage
- Tax amount now properly calculated on original price

### 2. Backend API Endpoints
**File:** `routes/api.php`

**Before (Incorrect):**
```php
$itemTax = $itemFinalPrice * ($dressItem->dress->tax_percentage / 100);
```

**After (Correct):**
```php
// GST should be calculated on original price (before discount)
$itemTax = $dressItem->dress->sale_price * ($dressItem->dress->tax_percentage / 100);
```

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Api/SaleController.php`

**Before (Incorrect):**
```php
'tax_amount' => ($itemData['final_price'] * $dress->tax_percentage) / 100,
```

**After (Correct):**
```php
// GST calculated on original price (before discount)
'tax_amount' => ($itemData['original_price'] * $dress->tax_percentage) / 100,
```

### 3. Print Invoice Generator
**File:** `resources/js/services/ThermalInvoiceGenerator.js`

**Display Update:**
- Changed from "Tax:" to "GST (18%):" in printed invoices
- Tax calculation now matches the corrected POS logic

## GST Calculation Logic

### Current Tax Percentage
- **GST Rate:** 18% (as defined in database seed data)
- **Applied On:** Original item price (before any discounts)

### Example Calculation
For an item with:
- Original Price: Rs. 1000
- Discount: Rs. 100 (10%)
- Final Price: Rs. 900

**Previous (Incorrect) Calculation:**
- GST = Rs. 900 × 18% = Rs. 162
- Total = Rs. 900 + Rs. 162 = Rs. 1062

**Current (Correct) Calculation:**
- GST = Rs. 1000 × 18% = Rs. 180
- Total = Rs. 900 + Rs. 180 = Rs. 1080

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Frontend POS tax calculation fixed
- Backend API tax calculation fixed  
- Print invoice display updated
- Frontend built and deployed

✅ **Verified:**
- Tax calculated on original price (pre-discount)
- Display shows "GST (18%)" instead of "Tax"
- Backend APIs updated to match frontend logic
- Print invoices updated to match new calculation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic GST Calculation:**
   - Add items with different prices to cart
   - Apply discounts to items
   - Verify GST is calculated on original price, not discounted price

2. **Invoice Verification:**
   - Complete a sale with discounted items
   - Check printed invoice shows "GST (18%)" 
   - Verify GST amount matches 18% of original prices

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Items with no discount (GST = 18% of sale price)
   - Items with various discount percentages
   - Multiple items with different discount types

## Files Modified
1. `resources/js/components/pos/AdvancedPOS.vue`
2. `routes/api.php`
3. `app/Http/Controllers/Api/SaleController.php`
4. `resources/js/services/ThermalInvoiceGenerator.js`

## Database Schema
No database changes required. The system uses existing:
- `dresses.tax_percentage` (currently 18%)
- `sale_items.tax_amount` (calculated value)
- `sales.tax_amount` (total tax for sale)

The fix ensures proper GST calculation according to standard accounting practices where tax is applied to the original price before any discounts.
