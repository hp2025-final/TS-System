# Collections Page Access Control - Complete

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed Header Elements
**Files Modified:**
- `resources/js/components/collections/CollectionsPage.vue`
- `resources/js/components/collections/CollectionList.vue`

**Elements Removed:**
- ❌ Header text: "Manage your boutique collections and inventory"
- ❌ "+ New Collection" button from main header
- ❌ Header description text in CollectionList

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
**Implemented role-based hiding of admin-only features for staff users.**

#### Admin Role (role: 'admin'):
✅ **Can See/Access:**
- All collections data (read access)
- Action buttons (Edit, View) in collections list
- "Create Collection" button in empty state
- Full administrative access

#### Staff Role (role: 'staff'):
✅ **Can See/Access:**
- All collections data (read-only access)
- Collection statistics and information
- Size breakdown data

❌ **Cannot See/Access:**
- Action buttons (Edit, View) in collections list
- Actions column header (hidden entirely)
- "Create Collection" button in empty state
- Administrative modification features

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Role Detection:
```javascript
import { useAuthStore } from '../../stores/auth.js';

const authStore = useAuthStore();

// Role-based access control
const isAdmin = computed(() => {
  return authStore.user?.role === 'admin';
});
```

#### Conditional Rendering:
```vue
<!-- Actions column header - only for admin -->
<th v-if="isAdmin" class="...">Actions</th>

<!-- Action buttons - only for admin -->
<td v-if="isAdmin" class="...">
  <div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
    <button>Edit</button>
    <button>View</button>
  </div>
</td>

<!-- Create Collection button - only for admin -->
<button v-if="isAdmin" class="...">Create Collection</button>
```

### 4. Updated UI Structure

#### Before:
- Collections page had management text and new collection button
- All users could see action buttons
- CollectionList had redundant header elements

#### After:
- Clean, minimal collections page header
- Role-based action button visibility
- Staff users see read-only interface
- Admin users retain full access
