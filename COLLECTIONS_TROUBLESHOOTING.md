# Collections Page Error Troubleshooting

## Issue
Collections page showing JavaScript errors and not displaying content.

## Potential Causes & Solutions

### 1. Browser Cache Issue
**Solution**: Hard refresh the browser
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
- Or open Developer Tools → Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 2. Authentication State Issue
**Check**: Open browser console and look for:
- Any 401 Unauthorized errors
- User object being null or undefined
- Token missing or invalid

### 3. Component Timing Issue
The error might be happening because the component is trying to access user data before it's loaded.

**Solution Applied**: Added error handling to all computed properties and initialization.

### 4. Recent Changes Made
1. Added `try-catch` blocks to all computed properties
2. Enhanced error handling in `onMounted` lifecycle
3. Made `isAdmin` computed more defensive
4. Rebuilt frontend with latest changes

### 5. Quick Debugging Steps
1. **Check Console**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Network Tab**: Check if API calls are being made and their responses
3. **Application Tab**: Check if user data is stored in localStorage
4. **Hard Refresh**: Clear browser cache and reload

### 6. Backend Verification
- ✅ Laravel server is running on port 8000
- ✅ User model has role field
- ✅ API routes are defined correctly
- ✅ Database has user data with roles

### 7. If Issue Persists
1. Check browser console for exact error message
2. Verify you're logged in properly
3. Check if localStorage has 'auth_token' and 'user' data
4. Try logging out and logging back in

## Current Code Status
- ✅ Debug logs removed
- ✅ Error handling added
- ✅ Frontend rebuilt
- ✅ Ready for testing
