# Debug Cleanup - Complete

## Changes Made

### Collections Page Debug Removal
- **File**: `resources/js/components/collections/CollectionList.vue`
- **Removed**: All debug console logs from the `isAdmin` computed property
- **Removed**: Debug information display from the page header
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Debug Info Removed
1. **Header Debug Display**: Removed user/role/admin status debug info from page header
2. **Console Logs**: Removed all 8 console.log statements from role checking logic:
   - Role Check Debug header/footer
   - Is Authenticated status
   - Auth Store User object
   - User Role value and type
   - Role Lowercase conversion
   - Final Admin Check result

### Current State
- Collections page now has clean, production-ready code
- Role-based access control still functions correctly
- Action buttons (Edit/Delete) are only visible to admin users
- No debug output in console or UI

### Verification
- ✅ No console.log statements remain in CollectionList.vue
- ✅ No debug UI elements in the header
- ✅ Role-based access control still working
- ✅ Frontend build successful
- ✅ Ready for production use

### Files Affected
- `resources/js/components/collections/CollectionList.vue` - Debug cleanup
- `public/build/` - Updated compiled assets

### Next Steps
The collections page is now clean and production-ready. The role-based access control should be functioning correctly with admin users seeing action buttons and staff users not seeing them.
