### 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

#### Discount System Logic
The system implements a sophisticated 3-level discount calculation:

1. **Collection Level Discount** - Applied to all dresses in a collection
2. **Dress Level Discount** - Specific to individual dress designs
3. **Item Level Discount** - Applied to specific inventory items

**Calculation Priority:**
- Item discount takes precedence
- If no item discount, dress discount applies
- If no dress discount, collection discount applies
- Final price = base_price × (1 - highest_applicable_discount/100)

#### Barcode Management
- Automatic barcode generation for new items
- Unique 13-digit barcodes
- Barcode lookup functionality
- Support for manual barcode entry

#### Security Features
- Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
- CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control
- Secure password hashing
