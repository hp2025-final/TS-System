# Actual Price Display Fix - Returns System

## Issue Identified
The returns system was displaying the base dress price (`sale_price`) instead of the actual amount paid (`item_total`) which includes discounts and GST. This caused confusion as users couldn't see the real transaction amounts.

## Screenshots Analysis
- **Screenshot 1**: Aliya XS showing PKR 5200.00 (base price) instead of actual paid amount
- **Screenshot 2**: Fatima XL showing PKR 11000.00 (base price) instead of actual paid amount
- **Price Difference**: Both items showing original dress prices without applied discounts/GST

## Root Cause
The Vue.js component was using `sale_price` field which contains the base dress price, instead of `item_total` field which contains the actual amount paid after discounts and GST calculations.

## Files Modified

### 1. ReturnsPage.vue
**File**: `resources/js/components/returns/ReturnsPage.vue`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Search Results Display (Line 417)**
   ```vue
   // Before
   <div class="font-medium text-gray-900">PKR {{ item.sale_price }}</div>
   
   // After  
   <div class="font-medium text-gray-900">PKR {{ item.item_total || item.sale_price }}</div>
   ```

2. **Step 2 Return Details (Line 442)**
   ```vue
   // Before
   Sold Price: PKR {{ selectedSoldItem.sale_price }} | Invoice: {{ selectedSoldItem.sale?.invoice_number }}
   
   // After
   Sold Price: PKR {{ selectedSoldItem.item_total || selectedSoldItem.sale_price }} | Invoice: {{ selectedSoldItem.sale?.invoice_number }}
   ```

3. **Exchange Price Comparison Fallback (Line 611)**
   ```vue
   // Before
   Original: PKR {{ selectedSoldItem.sale_price }} | 
   Exchange: PKR {{ selectedExchangeItem.dress.sale_price }}
   
   // After
   Original: PKR {{ selectedSoldItem.item_total || selectedSoldItem.sale_price }} | 
   Exchange: PKR {{ selectedExchangeItem.dress.sale_price }}
   ```

## Expected Results
After these changes:
- ✅ Search results will show actual paid amounts (including discounts and GST)
- ✅ Step 2 return details will display the real transaction amount
- ✅ Price comparisons will use actual paid amounts for accurate calculations
- ✅ Exchange items will still show current selling prices (correct behavior)

## Technical Details

### Field Usage:
- `item_total`: Contains actual amount paid (base price - discounts + GST)
- `sale_price`: Contains base dress price (no discounts/GST applied)

### Fallback Logic:
Using `item_total || sale_price` ensures compatibility with older records that might not have `item_total` populated.

### Exchange Items:
Exchange item selection correctly uses `dress.sale_price` as these are new items being selected, not previously sold items.

## Database Context
The `item_total` field is calculated in the SaleController and stored in the `sale_items` table, containing:
- Base price
- Minus any applicable discounts
- Plus GST (currently 10% in Pakistan)

## Testing Required
1. Search for returned items and verify actual paid amounts are displayed
2. Process returns and verify Step 2 shows correct sold price
3. Perform exchanges and verify price difference calculations use actual amounts
4. Test with items that had discounts applied during original sale
5. Verify GST-inclusive amounts are properly displayed

## Business Impact
- **Improved Accuracy**: Staff and customers see real transaction amounts
- **Better Decision Making**: Returns and exchanges based on actual paid amounts
- **Compliance**: Proper representation of tax-inclusive pricing
- **Customer Trust**: Transparent display of actual amounts paid
